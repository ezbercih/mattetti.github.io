During [RubyConf 2012](http://rubyconf.com/) in Denver, Colorado Matt
Aimonetti gave a talk entitled **Ruby Vs. The World**.

##Description of the talk:

Ruby is an awesome programming language, it's so pleasing you probably haven't seriously looked at other languages since you switched. The programming world is evolving fast, new languages are created daily, new trends are emerging. Let's take some time to look at a few languages from a Ruby developer perspective.
