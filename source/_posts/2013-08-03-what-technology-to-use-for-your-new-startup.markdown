Over the years many people asked me the same question:

> I'm starting this new project, what technology do you think I should use?

Often these people fit in one of two categories:

* Technologists who already made up their mind
* Non-technologist entrepreneurs who need to be reassured

At the end of the day, I doubt that many of these people actually cared
about my answers. They probably just wanted to know if we were on the same page or wanted to be reassured.

To be honest, as an engineer, **I think that a great idea can be built with almost any
technology**. They all have their pros/cons and you always have to pay a
certain price for whatever advantages your technical choices end up
being. To me, the chances of your project failing have more to do with
vision, leadership, execution, market than poor technological choices.

Now that I'm an entrepreneur, I make technical decisions daily. When I choose
a specific technology, I need to be able to justify the decision to myself, my
partners/employees and potential investors. The key to these decisions is that 
I make technical choices based on the project and company's vision.

For a project to be successful you must have a strong vision.
If you can convert your **vision** into a set of **values** to benchmark every decision, your path will be clear and it'll be easier to find the right people to join you.

Besides the vision, a lot of startups focus on culture. 
It is commonly said that the culture is defined by the founders, the first few employees, and
the product itself.
However, what isn't often mentioned is that **the technical
decisions will have a direct effect on the company culture**.

Whether your new startup is based on J2EE/Oracle, Perl, PHP, Rails, Node.js or
.NET, the team's engineers will have different expectations, different
values, and different concerns. None of these technologies are intrinsically bad,
great things have been built with each. But they do come with a culture.

A couple years ago, I met an entrepreneur who chose to
build his application in Node.js. Curious, I asked why he chose Node.
The response was simple:
* smart engineers are excited about it so I can more easily recruit
* people are willing to contribute for free because it builds their
  experience

This decision clearly set the engineering culture and defined the team of people
who could work or be interested in working on the project. 

## Asking a Different Question

So maybe instead of asking what technology I should use, we should ask ourselves:

> Does this technology fits my company's core values?

That's a much harder question because you need to actually understand your
core values. That understanding is key to building a successful product.

You can't blindly copy a tech stack in the same way you can't copy a business plan. It's a part of your company's identity. Your core values, your objectives, your team and your
expectations are different.

The whole _"it worked for X"_ argument is
rarely valid. Look, Facebook uses PHP, it "worked for them" does that mean we should all use PHP?

Technical decisions have cultural impact. Think clearly and carefully about **how your technologies align with your company's core values**. Make the right choices and you'll spend less time fighting about technical details and more time building a great business.
