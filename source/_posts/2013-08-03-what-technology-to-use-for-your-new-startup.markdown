Over the years many people asked me the same question:

> I'm starting this new project, what technology do you think I should use?

Often people asking this question fit in one of the following two
categories:

* Technologists who already made up their mind.
* Non-technologist entrepreneurs who need to be reassured.

At the end of the day, I doubt that many of these people actually cared
about my answers, they probably just wanted to know if we were on the same page or wanted to be reassured.

To be honest, as an engineer, **I think that any great idea can be built with almost any
technology**. They all have their pros/cons and you always have to pay a
certain price for whatever advantages your technical choices end up
being. _To me, the chances of your project failing have more to do with
vision, leadership, execution, market than poor technological choices_
(as long as you don't make totally silly choices that is, but then you
should blame leadership ;)). 


Now as an entrepreneur, I make technical decisions daily. When I choose
a specific technology, I need to be able to justify the decision to myself, my
partners/employees and potential investors. What I noticed and that I
think is key to making me feel good about these decisions is that 
I find myself making technical choices based on the project/company's vision.

I think we can all agree that for a project to be successful you need a
few things, but a strong vision is always key.
**If you can convert your vision into technical values, your life will be
much easier and you will also be able to find the right people to work
with you.**

But besides the vision, something a lot of startups are focusing on is a culture. 
It is commonly said that this culture is set by the vision cast by the founders, 
the product itself and the first few employees.
However, **what isn't often mentioned is that the technical
stack/decisions will
have a direct effect on the company culture** since most of the first people will
have to deal with the pros/cons of the technical decisions we make.
If your new startup is based on J2EE/Oracle, Perl, PHP, Rails, Node.js or
.NET, involved engineers will have different expectations, different
values, different concerns. None of these technologies are intrinsically bad,
lots of people built great things with them. But they do come with
baggage and a culture/community.

Around a couple years ago, I met an entrepreneur who chose to
build his application in Node.js. Curious, I asked why he chose Node.
The response was simple:
* smart engineers are excited about it so I can more easily recruit.
* people are willing to contribute for free because it builds their
  experience.

Looking back, I don't know if this person would make the same decision, but
at least his choice was rationale and easy to explain. This decision clearly 
and objectively set the engineering culture, defined the team of people
who could work or be interested in working on the project. 


## Asking a different question

So maybe instead of asking what technology I should use, we should ask ourselves:

> Does this technology fits my company's core values?

That's a much harder question because it requires to have your
core values well defined and easily understood by all. Something which
by the way I think is also key to building a successful product.

Because your core values, your objectives, your team and your
expectations are more than likely different from other companies', don't
just copy other tech stacks. The whole _"it worked for X"_ argument is
rarely valid. Look, Facebook uses PHP, it "worked for them" does that mean we should all use PHP?
Maybe, maybe not especially after Wordpress' co-founder said that if he could, he
would rewrite it all in [#golang](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg781/i_am_matt_mullenweg_cofounder_of_wordpress_18_of/cbed1jk) but it worked for WP and it might work for you.

Thinking about the business and culture sides of each technical decision will
help your company get closer to the defined goals while following its
core values. 
**Clearly link your technical decisions with your company's
vision and I can assure that you will spend way less time in useless,
time consuming technical arguments** _(and if you miss tech arguments, come
