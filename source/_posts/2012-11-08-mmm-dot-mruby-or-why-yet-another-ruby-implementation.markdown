During [Aloha RubyConf 2012](http://aloharubyconf.com/) in Honolulu, Hawaii Matt
Aimonetti gave a talk entitled **mmm..mruby or why yet another Ruby implementation**.

##Description of the talk:

mruby is Matz’ new Ruby implementation, it’s not cooler than node.js, it doesn’t natively support Hypstermedia,
 it looks just like the good old Ruby. So why should we, as a community care?

Matt's talk is divided in two parts, an introduction of mruby (embedded
Ruby) and and revisiting Ruby.
